# Dotfiles for homeshick

Underneath this uses homeshick to do all the heavy lifting, but i like to keep
my vim repo separate from things.

To simplify matters for my own setup, run

```
git clone https://github.com/annonymouse/dotfiles
cd dotfiles
./deploy.sh
```

Deploy.sh is idempotent if you've already got things installed.
